= AARCHIE: Guide to app architecture

https://developer.android.com/jetpack/docs/guide

.Common architectural principles
. Separation of concerns
. Drive UI from a model

.Recommended app architecture
. Build the user interface
. Fetch data
+
> ViewModel delegates the data-fetching process to a new module, a _repository_.

.. Manage dependencies between components
... Dependency injection (DI)
... Service locator
. Connect `ViewModel` and the repository
. Cache data
. Persist data
.. *Single source of truth*: _the database serves as the single source of truth_
. Show in-progress operations
. Test each component
.. User interface and interactions. 
.. ViewModel
.. UserRepository
.. UserDao
.. Webservice
.. Testing Artifacts

.Best practices
. Avoid designating your app's entry points—such as activities, services, and broadcast receivers—as sources of data.
. Create well-defined boundaries of responsibility between various modules of your app.
. Expose as little as possible from each module.
. Consider how to make each module testable in isolation.
. Focus on the unique core of your app so it stands out from other apps.
. Persist as much relevant and fresh data as possible.
. Assign one data source to be the single source of truth.

== UI that shows a user profile

.files
. UserProfileFragment 
. user_profile_layout.xml
. UserProfileViewModel 
. Webservice
+
> it abstracts the data sources from the rest of the app


.ac
. LiveData
. MutableLiveData
